# Strike Wallet UX & Product Analysis  
(Reference: Strike – Bitcoin Payments App)

---

## 1. Onboarding & UX Flow

### What is the first screen a new user sees?

The first screen presents:
- **Login** and **Sign Up** options  
- A short, clear value proposition message  
- A minimal, distraction-free layout  

The interface immediately communicates that the app is focused on sending and receiving money powered by Bitcoin.

---

### How does the wallet introduce itself? (Branding, messaging, first impression)

Strike introduces itself with:
- A clean lightning strike animation  
- Subtle haptic feedback (gentle vibration)  
- Clear, direct messaging  
- Minimal UI clutter  

**First impression:**
- Modern and polished  
- Focused on primary actions  
- Emotionally engaging through motion and feedback  
- Low cognitive load  

The app feels intentional and product-led rather than feature-heavy.

---

### Are there any confusing steps or friction points?

Overall, the onboarding flow is linear and easy to follow. There are very few confusing steps.

**Observed friction points:**

- **KYC Process**
  - No visible progress bar  
  - No indication of how long it will take  
  - Exiting the KYC flow prompts a logout modal, which may create fear or uncertainty  
  - Feels slightly intimidating despite the otherwise smooth UX  

- **Mandatory 2FA at every login**
  - Strong security posture  
  - May feel repetitive or inconvenient for frequent users  

---

### Does the onboarding process assume prior Bitcoin knowledge?

The onboarding assumes little to some Bitcoin knowledge.

However:
- It avoids technical jargon  
- It simplifies concepts  
- It focuses on “sending money” instead of teaching Bitcoin mechanics  

The experience is highly accommodating for beginners, even if they are new to Bitcoin.

## 2. Security & Backup

### How does the wallet handle seed phrases, backups, or security steps?

Strike shares recovery codes in a:
- Straightforward
- Direct
- Minimal-information format  

It:
- Explains what recovery codes are for  
- Provides next-step guidance  
- Encourages users to store them securely  

However:
- There are limited tooltips  
- Educational depth is minimal  
- The explanation could be more detailed for first-time users  

---

### Are security concepts explained clearly, or just enforced?

Security concepts such as:
- 2FA  
- Backup codes  
- Recovery access  

Are explained clearly rather than just enforced.

Users are told:
- Why security steps matter  
- What they protect  
- The consequences of losing access  

This builds trust and reduces confusion.

---

### How does it balance security and ease of use?

Strike balances security and usability through:

- Clean UI with one primary action per screen  
- Clear hierarchy and minimal text  
- Structured and calm security flows  

Security feels integrated rather than overwhelming.

The only tension point is:
- Mandatory 2FA at every login  

Overall, the balance between protection and simplicity is well executed.

---

## 3. Bitcoin Education & Concept Explanation

### Does the wallet explain self-custody? If so, how?

Strike lightly introduces the concept of ownership when displaying recovery codes.

However:
- It does not strongly emphasize the meaning of self-custody  
- It does not deeply explain the responsibility involved  
- Beginners may not fully understand what ownership implies  

There is room for clearer emphasis on self-custody principles.

---

### How does it introduce fees, transactions, and Bitcoin vs. Lightning?

Strike simplifies and abstracts complexity.

- Fees are not deeply explained  
- Lightning vs. on-chain differences are mostly hidden  
- The app prioritizes usability over technical education  

Users interact with money movement without needing to understand the infrastructure behind it.

---

### Are there tooltips, help sections, or embedded education materials?

There is:
- Basic contextual guidance  
- Clear labels for actions  

However:
- Tooltips are minimal  
- No structured in-app Bitcoin education  
- Limited embedded learning resources  

The product prioritizes adoption and simplicity over in-depth Bitcoin literacy.

---

## Overall UX Positioning

Strike’s philosophy appears to be:

> “Make Bitcoin feel like normal money.”

It excels at:
- Clean onboarding  
- Security clarity  
- Reducing intimidation for beginners  

It could improve:
- Add a subtle KYC progress bar 
- Self-custody education emphasis  
- Optional limited access before full KYC completion  
- Add contextual micro-tooltips for recovery code importance. 
- Introduce a beginner mode vs advanced mode. 
- Add optional “Learn Bitcoin Basics” onboarding track.
